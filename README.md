# Race03
The task was to find the shortest route between two points in a maze.

The maze must have the following stucture : 

#,#,#,#

#,.,.,#

#,#,.,#

#,.,.,#

#,#,#,#

Where '#' is an obstacle,   '.' is an empty space,    ',' is a delimiter

To run it, use make and then pass these arguments in your terminal: /way_home [pathToMazeTxt] [startingX] [startingY] [pathEdnX] [pathEndY].
